I am an AI Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI Research, Vietnam</a>. I also spent two wonderful years at VinAI as an AI Research Resident under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/">Thien Huu Nguyen</a>. I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.hust.edu.vn/">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>.

## My work and research
My research interest lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Recently, I have focused on the following research problems:
* Building robust Question Answering model
* Controllable text generation
